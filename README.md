# ORBCOMM receiver
A software receiver for ORBCOMM satellite transmissions.  

Please read the wiki for more information: https://github.com/fbieberly/ORBCOMM-receiver/wiki  

## Description

This is a software receiver for decoding packets from ORBCOMM satellites. For known packet types the packet data is decoded.  

I am writing this decoder as an instructional personal project. Hopefully it
can be used by others to learn about designing satellite communication
receivers.

## Dependencies

Should work with either Python 2.X or 3.X

I use:  
[pyrtlsdr] to record the RF signal with an RTLSDR receiver.  
[NumPy] and [SciPy] are used for signal processing.  
[PyEphem] is used to calculate Az/El and doppler shift of the satellites.  
[Matplotlib] is used for plotting data.

pip install pyrtlsdr, numpy, scipy, pyephem, matplotlib

## Getting started

#### Offline recording and decoding
1. First run the _update_orbcomm_tle.py_ script to get the latest two-line elements for the ORBCOMM satellites.
2. Update latitude and longitude of your receiver in _CONFIG.py_
3. Record IQ data by running _record_orbcomm.py_
4. Run _file_decoder.py_ to decode a single recording file (defaults to the first file in the /data folder)
    1. The file it decodes is selected near the top of the file (Line 37). Change it there if you wish to decode other files.
    1. Note: There are 2 data files that come with this repo. If you want to process your own recordings, you'll need to remove those files (or just point the file_decoder.py script to your files).

#### Real-time recording and decoding
1. First run the _update_orbcomm_tle.py_ script to get the latest two-line elements for the ORBCOMM satellites.
2. Update latitude and longitude of your receiver in _CONFIG.py_
3. Run _realtime_receiver.py_
    1. If there is no satellite overhead it will tell you how long the wait is.
    1. I recommend you use [gPredict] to know where the ORBCOMM satellites are.
    1. Note that not all the ORBCOMM satellites still transmit. Look in _sat_db.py_ to see the active ones.

## DSP Training

In the dsp_training folder are a number of scripts that I used to help me understand the DSP that I needed to decode the ORBCOMM signals. The scripts are simulation only and help understand phase recovery, timing recovery, creating symbols from bits, mixing, filtering, etc.



## Scripts


Scripts include:
- sat_db.py: just a dictionary of ORBCOMM satellites I know are active
- orbcomm_packet.py: a list of all the known ORBCOMM packet types and their components
- helpers.py: a file with useful helper functions
- plot_recording_waterfall.py: plots a waterfall of recordings
- update_orbcomm_tle.py: downloads the latest ORBCOMM tles from celestrack.com
- record_orbcomm.py: records ORBCOMM satellites when they are overhead with an RTLSDR
- file_decoder.py: If you have .mat files in the data folder, this script will attempt to decode one
- realtime_decoder.py: This is a class for doing decoding of a realtime stream of samples
- realtime_receiver.py: This is a script that does realtime decoding of the ORBCOMM signal, plus some interesting plots

## Data format

In the data folder is a couple files of samples that I have recorded.

The files are .mat files. They can be opened with MATLAB or Python (using SciPy's loadmat function).

The files include metadata:
- fc: center frequency
- fs: sample rate
- sats: a list of the names of the satellites overhead
- tles: a list of lists of the tle lines for each satellite (in the order of the sats list)
- timestamp: unix time of the start of the recording
- samples: a numpy complex64 array of the samples
- lat: the latitude of the receiver when the samples were recorded
- lon: the longitude of the receiver when the samples were recorded
- alt: the elevation of the receiver when the samples were recorded

Look at the file_decoder.py script to see an example of how to access the metadata.
